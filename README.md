# openai-api-gui
OpenAI Api as a GUI. Makes life way easier when trying to fine-tune models.

So, the purpose of this application is to make life easier when using the OpenAI api. Currently it does not support the development of datasets using the OpenAI CLI Data Preperation Tool, but it may be added. There are also the optional hyperparameters that havnt yet been added, but depending on responses, it may be considered. I hope this comes of some use to someone atleast, and yeah I thought it'll be a fun mini-project to complete as a beginner in Python.

Anyways, take care! :)
